# Polarity IPInfo Integration

Polarity's IPInfo integration gives users access to automated IPv4 and IPv6 lookups within ipinfo.

ipinfo is a REST based service that provides information about IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  You can sign up for a paid ipinfo plan to increase your daily lookup limit.  The free plan is limited to 50,000 lookups per month.
